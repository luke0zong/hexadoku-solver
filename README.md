# Hexadoku Solver With Constraint Propagation and DFS Search
This is a final project for CS 440 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at CSU

Traditional Sudoku is a 9x9 number puzzle. In this project, we study an algorithm to solve 16x16 Sudoku - Hexadoku. This algorithm involves Constraint Propagation and Depth First Search.
